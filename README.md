### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Roark Martin. I grew up in Eastern Iowa and have been an Iowa State Fan since I was very young. I am interested in learning more basics of coding and improving on my coding skills. My favorite hobby at the moment is Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, I have also been spending some time building model aircraft.
